# Urban-Scene-AI
Using vision language models to understand urban driving scenes
âœ… Project Explanation
Your project, Urban-Scene-AI, uses Vision-Language Models (e.g., CLIP) to automatically identify and understand unusual or critical situations in urban driving scenes.

ðŸŽ¯ Aim
Enhance autonomous driving safety by automatically detecting and describing rare or complex urban scenes (e.g., accidents, roadworks, unexpected pedestrian behavior).

ðŸ“Œ Dataset to Use
nuScenes (urban driving with rich annotations, ideal for autonomous driving tasks)

Alternative: BDD100K (Berkeley DeepDrive â€“ urban road scenarios)
